# Growth API (GAPI)  [MC 1.12.2]

Growth API is an API written in Java-8 which is meant to ease the modification of
 growth-processes in Minecraft.
 
 From a programmatic perspective, GAPI is a set of interfaces 
 with extensive default-implementations, which are aimed at 
 easing the process of creating replacements and extensions for default-included implementations.
 
 
 GAPI, as it currently stands, is a back-end extension and thus will not provide any changes to Minecraft's gameplay.
 
 For a quick start, include the api as a runtime-dependency and read the wiki for the 1st steps!
