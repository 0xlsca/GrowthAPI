# Growth API (GAPI)  [MC 1.12.2]

Growth API is an API written in Java 8 which is meant to ease the modification of
 growth-processes in Minecraft.
 
 GAPI, as it currently stands, is a backend extension and thus will not provide any changes to Minecraft's gameplay on
 its own.
 
 For a quick start, include the api as a runtime dependency and read the wiki!
 
 ## Todo until next release:

[0.0.6 release project](https://github.com/TomConnery/GrowthAPI/projects/2)
